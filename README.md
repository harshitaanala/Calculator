## Conclusion

This project was created as a fun and experimental exploration of Tkinter, Python’s built-in GUI toolkit. It serves as a great way to learn and experiment with GUI development while building a functional and visually appealing calculator.

What is Tkinter?
Tkinter is the standard Graphical User Interface (GUI) library for Python, providing a simple yet powerful way to create interactive desktop applications. It is lightweight, easy to use, and comes pre-installed with Python, making it a great choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

This project demonstrates how Tkinter can be used to design a clean, responsive, and efficient calculator, while also encouraging further exploration into event handling, layout management, and custom styling in GUI applications.
